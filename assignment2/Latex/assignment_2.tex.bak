\section{Difference in Difference}






\subsection{Task 1: Derive Diff-In-Diff Coefficients}

\centering
$(1-1) \ {y_{it}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} D_i + \beta_{2} T_t+ \beta_{3} D_i T_t + \epsilon_{it}$



Considering the canonical difference-in-difference equation expressed in regression form (1-1), the individaul outcome of ${y_{it}}$ is defined by five terms:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\beta_{0}$; constant - will be cancelled out in later part
	\item $\beta_{1} D_i$; treatment indicator - whether the subject is treated or not represented by either (D= 1$ | $D = 0)
	\item $\beta_{2} T_t$; independent of the subject, the "event study" contains pre- and post-test measurements indicator for each subject
	\item $\beta_{3} D_i T_t$; the interaction effect of the treatment indicator and the time indicator displays the assumed effect of the change from pre to post test in $T_t$ for an individual in the treatment or control - in case of treatment, this term falls out as the general assumtion of diff-in-diff pertains to the control being the same as the treatment. 
	\item $\epsilon_{it}$; contains the disturbances
\end{enumerate}


The terms in 2, 3, \& 4 are relevant in describing the following outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\item $E = (y_{T=1} | D=1)$
\item $E = (y_{T=0} | D=1)$
\item $E = (y_{T=1} | D=0)$
\item $E = (y_{T=0} | D=0)$
\end{itemize}

Difference in difference means that we compare the difference between treatment and control before and after the treatment introduction (t = 0), shown as:


\centering
$
(1-2) \ [E(y_{T=1} | D=1) - E(y_{T=0} | D=1)] - [E(y_{T=1} | D=0) - E(y_{T=0} | D=0)]
$

Subsequetnly, the four outcomes described in (1-2) yield the following outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\item $E = (y_{T=1} | D=1)$; Becasue we are observing the outcome for the post-(treatment) test for treatment group, this yields $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$, $\beta_{2}$,  $\beta_{3}$ 
\item $E = (y_{T=0} | D=1)$; Because we are observing the outcome of the pre-(intervention) test for the treatment, this will yield $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$
\item $E = (y_{T=1} | D=0)$; Becasue we are observing the outcome for the post-(treatment) test for the control group, this yields $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{2}$ 
\item $E = (y_{T=0} | D=0)$; Because we are observing the outcome of the pre-(intervention) test for the control, this will yield $\beta_{0}$
\end{itemize}

Note that the disturbance term is left out as it is assumed to be independent of the treatment selection etc.; as such we will ignore it here. 
Additionally, the constant is present in all four outcomes; thus, it also cncels out in the following equation. This originates from the assumption that the covariates measurments in pre and post test yield the same results for both treatment and control subjects. Equivalently, by substitution the aforementioned outcomes into (1-2), the following results can be deduced:

$
(1-3) \ [E(y_{T=1} | D=1) - E(y_{T=0} | D=1)] - [E(y_{T=1} | D=0) - E(y_{T=0} | D=0)]
$

$
(=) E  = [(\beta_{1} + \beta_{2} + \beta_{3}) - 
$

Important: we canot identify the monthrs; so If they become mothers at some point, we will assume that these are taken out!




\subsection{Task 2: Provide graphic as on slide 55}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Describe each picture and what you can see; but also note that this is based on averages and not statistically true
   \item IMPORTANT: you should look at the grading grid of the previous assignment to see what their requirements are for these
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{IMPORTANT: ALSO MENTION THE CATEGORICAL VARIABLES!!!}

NOTES: This "visoual" proof is no real proove; this is just visual confirmation of what we assume; but does this really pertain to the case that the TAX credit is the real cause? What about the case of subsections of the population? and we still do not know whether this is really causal and not like the economy heating up!`
Predictor is WHETHER YOU HAVE CHILD OR NOT


\subsection{Task 3: Summary Statistics for data}


\begin{enumerate}
   \item  dont forget to mention the categorical variables and how they distribute; you did this well during assignment 1
   \item better only keep the table with overall stats and not the subcategories 
   \item add skew and median!!

\subsection{Task 4: Matrix Diff in Diff}
NOte: by taking the average of the periods we have two small problems: 1) the AFTER period is longer; so should we really do that?

\begin{enumerate}
   \item report the same insight as you did during class! 
   \item IMPORTANT: CHECK AND CALCULATE THE TABLE CONTENTS AGAIN! THERE MIGHT BE SOME NUMBERS OFF!!

\subsection{Task 5: Analyze the DiD effect with appropriate regression models for the three
dependent variables}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item ADD A LITTLE THEORY WHY YOU ADD EACH CONTROL VAIRABLE into each model for each dependent variable! this is important: so put some effort into arguing why to include eg UNEMPLOYMENT rate into the equation of earnings (a good arugment would be: high unemployment means more people searching jobs means wage suppression ; a simple demand and suply rule)
   \item create an example table that reports exactly the same as that one above, but here the SEs are robust!!! for clustered on state and white; they will not really differ so also report the breusch pagan test here
   \item RUN BREUSCH PAGAN OFR EACH MODEL
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{NOTE STANDARDIZED COEFFICIENTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS THEY ARE USELESS IN THIS CONTEXT; WE ARE NOT LOOKIGN FOR EFFECT SIZE BUT RATHER THE CASE OF }


\textbf{Note:standardized coefficinets will NOT be included as they are of no interpretable interest here and there is no real effect size we want to estimate in the first place.}

\textbf{Also: give a short theroy for why control variables were included! LOOK AT PQRM QUANTITATIVE CORUSE AT UVA; THEY CALLED IT SOMETHING SPECIAL!}

\textbf{IMPORTANT: EXPLAIN WHY IN CERTAIN MODELS THE CONTROL VARIABLES WORK AND WHY THEY DONT WORK IN OTHER MODELS!! Build a theory in this regard }

\textbf{NOTE ROBUST STANDARD ERROS MIGHT NOT EVEN BE NEEDED IN THIS CASE DUE TO THE THEORY BEHIND DIFF IN DIFF }

\textbf{NOTE: WRITE A THEORY FOR EACH CONTROL VARIBALE REGARDING EACH DEPEDNET: EG THE urate may not ahve a controllign effect on earnings but it may have on family income }

\textbf{NOTE WE STILL USE DIFF IN DIFF BECAUSE WE STILL WANT TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THE POLICY INTERVATION JUST HERE SUBSECTIONED BY DIFFERENT VARIABLES }

\textbf{GENERAL ASSUMTION: ALL WOMEN ARE SINGLE WOMEN IN THE DATA SET}

\section{Tart 2 Instrumental Variable approach}


Notes:
- Effect of cumpulsory schooling on wages

Generaly: the quality and quantitiy of education in modern societies is on a steady rise; but it is difficult how much education contributes to future earnings on the labor market.. meansing: how much does one year of additional education add in earnings

This is because of unobserved factors that are to the detrimetn of assumtion 3 (mean independence) biasing any OLS estimate of wages on years of eduction (ommitted variables and confounders).

Here the solution: instruments to circumvent these biases; combining to characteristics: 
--> Minimum legal school dropout age (which can be 16, 17, or 18 years) 
--> and the annual quarter of birth of a person

Rational behind these choices: all students born in the sam year are admitted to school in the same cohort (the same class). BUT A student born in eg January reaches the leagal school dropout age earlier than a student born in September 8eg).

--> as such, the instruments function as if; we randomize school exposure to students, assuming that in each year, a constant fraction of students drops out of school adn this dorpout pattern is unrelated to when a students is born. 

\textbf{MAIN TASK: Estimate the effect of the yerars of education on the LOG scaled wages}

\subsection{Task 1: Explain wHY ols is biased here - A3}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item see slide 67; 
   \item mention that this is a 1930s during the great depression!
   \item %https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ivreg/vignettes/ivreg.html
   \item %https://rpubs.com/wsundstrom/t_ivreg
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{mention why Years of education is endogenous}

\textbf{ We therefore use geographical proximity to a college when growing up as an exogenous instrument for education}

\textbf{INCLUDE EXOGENEOUS VARIABLES AS WELL IN THE  INSTRUMENTAL PART!!!}

\textbf{SLIDE 67 ff}
\textbf{IMPORTANT SEE SLIDES 7 ff!!!.}
--> IMPORTANT: ALSO INCLDUE 1) THE METHOD OF IV being different than least squares (it is a method look up in notes) and 2) mention the two requirements for a good Instrument: a) cleanliness no impact on outcome causally only through the biased independent varaible and b) the relevance which is high correlcion with the independent varaibvles that are instrumentalized

\textbf{In this exercies give two examples of conditions that could bias the estimated education effect if only OLS is used; This means: give examples how the variable YEARSOFEDUCATION is a biased estimator becasue mean independece is violated --> the example given was: students preference for education may influence how long they stay in school and how much they earn on the labor market which is simply their ambition; other factors might be: family background and societal status/ socioeconomic status which means something like teen pregnancy OR IN THE 1930s during the great depression just the need to support the family during time of need so you could not go to school}

\textbf{eg IQ is a good thing}


\subsection{Task 2: Summary statistics for this task}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item remember to describe categorical variables in text
   \item add skew and median!!
\end{enumerate}


relevant quantiative variables age, educ (years of education), lnwage(weekly earnings), marrital status; quarter of birth of the recorded child; SMSA: categorical variable where someone lives (urban vs not urban); yob year of birth which is also categorical

--> possibly retransform lnwage to just wage by reversing the log scaling

\end{table}



\subsection{Task 3: Diagnositcs of Year Of Birth as instrument: is it any good?}
\textbf{see slide 88; 82}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item here already use the regression outputs from task 4 and also the a correlation table 
   \item add a plot!!!
   \item partial f test for relevance/ strength of the instrument!
   \item summary(rslt2SLS.B, diagnostics = TRUE) --> see the things in tutorial 2 there I descibe all of it; also the slides are relevant
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{A good instrument possesses two specifications: it is clean and it is relevant}

Cleanlieness: means that the Instrument only has an impact on the outcome through the Indepdendent variable (the to be "instrumentalized" variable); this assumption cannot be tested but is rather grounded in theory (meaning that the instrument is exogeneous -- obviously you cannot test exogineity)

Relevantce: Contrarily, this assumption can be tested: it states that the instrument used for the "to be instrumentalize" variable is strong, meaning that there is a relevant correlation between the instrument and the independent variables. Note: a correlation between the instrument adn the independent variables beyond the baised variable is welcome. It only becomes a problem when the instrument and the dependent varaible are related; btu there will always be some correlation in that regard. To this end, an anova is run on the two stage model in order to conduct the F test, which helps with multiple outputs: Wu-Hausman, Sargan, and F test (the former two are only relevant if the model is overidentified by the instrument)

\textbf{HOW DO I CONDUCT THESE TESTS? CAN I CONDUCT THEM ON THE NORMAL 2SLS via OLS or should I better use the IVreg model?}



\subsection{Task 4: Conduct IVreg of the effect of effect of education on log wages, using quarter of birth as the instrument; are robust SE needed?}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BUILD A QUICK THEORY AND ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTROL VARIABLES ARE EXOGENOEUS; SO WHY THERE CONTROLS ARE RELEVANT!!!!!
   \item also look at the examples in those links how they didd this !
\end{enumerate}

SLIDE 99
IMPORTANT: USE slide 88 as an argument

\textbf{IMPORTANT: WHEN YOU SAY HOW CONTROL VARIABLES IMPACT THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE SAY THE INCLUSION OF THE CONTROL VARIABLES ICNREASE IT INTO A CERTAIN DIRECTIOn; SO DEPEDNING ON THE INSTRUMENT VS NORMAL OLS, the variable was biased eg downwards or upwards}

\subsection{5 -- }
\begin{enumerate}
   \item here we do the parital F test on the IV regression!
   \item loot in the notes for this lecture to see the argument begind this f test 
   \item also analyse the hausman and sargan test on the same models as before; IMPORTANT THESE ARE ONLY FOR OVERIDENTIFICATION!!!
   \item important: perform all these tests like in the tutorial and also part 3/4 already!!!! -- report all those tests formally in one table!
\end{enumerate}



\textbf{IMPORTANT: WE DO NOT INCLUDE THE INSTRUMENTS IN OLS BECASUE WE AUSSME THAT THEY DONT HAVE AN IMPACT on the outcome!!!!!! in OLS; SO DONT INCLDUE THEM IN THE OLS OTHERWISE WE GO AGAINST THE UNDERLYING THEORY}
\textbf{SLIDE 105 perform partial F test to see whether IV reg is good or not and if it is good then it is better than OLS!}

\textbf{for overidentificaion run another IVREG WITH MORE insturments see introductiomn; then you can interpret the SARGAN AND HAUSMA TEST THINGI}

\subsection{6 -- }

\begin{enumerate}
   \item not clean insutruments! this would lead to violation of mean independence
   \item weak insturments leads to mean indepdence violation as well becasue the indstruments simply do not work as they should 
   \item google some stuff and see internet
\end{enumerate}



reasons: not clear instrument (or not clean) (make a plot; or if the instrument is not relevant or weak)
