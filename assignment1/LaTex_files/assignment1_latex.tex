\section{Data Prep, EDA, and Theory development}
\subsection{Varaible Selection \& Explanation}
\indent For the purpose of analyzing the determinats of house (sales) prices in the US a theory was developed based on combining two common valuation strategies in real-estate; "vergleichswert verfahren, sachwert verfahren".

\indent Based on the theory, four categories of regressors were identified in the data, promising to best represent the population regression equation. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Size related quantities (House size, lot size); garage
  \item District and Neighborhood dependent variables; Zoning
  \item type of housing (one family home, apartment, etc)
  \item Quality and condition of the house; including time since remodeling
\end{itemize}

To this end, this reasearch assignemnt draws data from an apprisal project conducted by... in the Ames district, Iowa (USA) (CITE DATA SOURCE HERE!!!). Corresponding to the aforementioned data categories, the following variables were selected to be used in varying degrees in the model. It may be noted, that due to the data being limited to a city in the midwest of the USA, the generalization resulting from this research may only extend to similar cities. However, due to the data originating from one district alone results in the comparability of the sale instances recorded in the data; meaning that stark contrasts in sales prices may be less due to the simple fact that one sale may have been made in Iowa and the other in New York, which naturally yields higher prices.

To start, a total of 1,460 house sales were recorded between 2006 and 2010 for the district of Ames, Iowa (USA). The dependent varibale was identified to be SalePrice. As can be observed in Table 1, the mean sale price of a house was \$180,921.20 (SD = 79,442.50). Combined with the range [34,900, 755,000] a positive skewness was to be expected (skew = 1.881), considering that the outcome variable is a of financial nature.

\indent Following, the first category of data pertains to size related dimensions of the property sold. More specifically, the total living area (tot\_living\_area)\footnote{defined as summing above- and below- ground or base living.} displays a mean of 2,572.89 square feet (SD = 823.598) in addition to a large reange of values[334, 11,752]; suggesting that the sales were conducted in neighborhoods (Neighborhood) included range from urban to (partially) rural. To this end, the second data category encompasses the zoning classification (MSZoning) which identifies neighborhoods and the correpsonding sales as rural or not. Neighborhood consisists of 25 distinctions and zoning of eight categories\footnote{only 5 categories actually contain data.}, which will be adjusted to three categories to decrease the complexity of the data analysis (see Appendix for a contignecy table). Additionally, the number of bedrooms above ground level (mean = 2.866, SD = 0.816) (BedroomAbvGr) and the number of bathrooms (mean = 1.990, SD = 0.732) are included (tot\_bathrooms)\footnote{The correlation betwen house size and number of bedrooms and bathrooms will be addressed later}. 
\indent Moreover, the third class of data was selected to balance size and neighborhood related associations by consideringh building type (BldgType), which consists of five categories. Interestingly, the majority of sold homes were one-family homes (n = 1220); this variable was adjusted to reduce the complexity of the data analysis and remove confusion about the definition of building type.
\indent The fourth category contains quality and condition related variables. Both variables are on a discrete  scale from one to ten. Quality displays values for each quality rating (mean = 6.099, SD = 1.383), while the condition ranges from one to nine (mean = 5.575, SD = 1.113).

It is notable that upon selecting the aforementioned variables, no preprossessing in the form of imputation or data deletion had to be applied. However, in order to decrease the complecity of the interaction term, the variable MSZoning was binned into (rural, mixed rural, and urban) based on the corresponding zoning categories\footnote{$https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data$}.


\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}\footnote{The theory underlying the choice of the variables will be further elaborated upon in Section 2}
A scatter plot matrix is provided in the appendix for the numeric variables. The EDA shows the four data categories with respect to the sale price of the property. Thus, the plots represented, inter alia, drove the development of the hypothesis down the line in combination with the aforementioned valuation strategies. 



first analysis:
Size of living area to sales price with respect to building type

Second analysis
total rooms and sales price with respect to size zoning

Third analysis
quality and condition to sales price

\indent Based on the valuation strategies and EDA discussed above, a theory was set up to explain the variation in sales prices. The corresponding causal relationship scheme can be seen in Plot 1. 

\paragraph{Hypothesis 1:} \textbf{Plot XXX} displays a potential direct positive association between Total Living Space (IV) and Sale Price (DV). Thus, one expects that larger houses have a higher sale price. Consequently,we assume that:

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:first}] \label{hyp:first}
Total living space (IV) has a direct postive association with Sales Price (DV)
\end{hyp}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\centering
 	\node at (1.5,0.85) {\textbf{Plot 2: Hypothesis 1}};
 	\node (1) at (0,0) {Total Living Space};
	\node (2) [right = of 1] {Sales Price};
	\path (1) edge node[above] {$+$}(2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


\indent Subsequently, when taking the Zoning (MSZoning or MSZoning\_grouped - IV) into account to reflect the administrative borderrs of the Ames districts, larger houses in more densly populated areas of the city appear to have a lower price when compared to houses of same size in less densly populated areas. This suggests a separation between "downtown less affluent areas" and "suburban affluent areas"\footnote{As an extention\: we will test whether the groups of Neighborhoods generally stay in the same zoning category; if Neighborhoods and Zoning are not related (so eg 50 \% of one neighborhood is in rural zone while the other part is in moderately populated zone) then we have a problem that this woudl induce a bias. Otherwise, we can just proceed.} and concludes in the hypothesis that

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:second}] \label{hyp:second}
Zoning moderates the direct effect of Total Living Space and Sales Price, while having itself an impact on the Sale Price. Moreover, less densly populated zones have a more positive association with Slaes Price than more densely populationed zones. This will be displayed in the appendix.
\end{hyp}

\indent Thirdly, it is intuitive that the Quality (IV) of a construction at least in part explains its valuation. However, as was discovered during the EDA in part 1 as well as the suggestions made in the reviewed valuation strategies, such an association commonly cluster. Thus, Neighborhood (IV) is assumed to moderate the direct effect of Quality on Sales Price, while itself displaying a positive effect on Sales Price; the argument being that richer households group together and create as a cluster more qualitative (expensive) homes, which then results in an increase sales price 

\begin{hyp}[H\ref{hyp:third}] \label{hyp:third}
Neighborhood of a property moderates the relationship of Quality on Sales Price, while displaying a positive relationship itself. 
\end{hyp}

 	\node at (1.5,1) {\textbf{Plot 4: Hypothesis 3}};
